1.	Accepted data formats: The Mathematica notebook accepts measurement files as generated by the instrument software. They have to contain the time coordinate, the measured head height, the smoothed measured head height, and the force. The file has to contain both the approach as well as the oscillation segments.
2.	Instructions: Specify the filename (variable filename) relative to the notebook location, specify the particle radius (variable particleRadius), enable/disable surface energy compensation (variable compensateSurfaceEnergy), specify the particle radius (variable particleRadius), the phase correction information (variables phaseOffset and phaseSlope), as well as the touchdown mode (variable touchdown).
Touchdown “Snap”: Specify the filter length (variable snapFilterLength), the keepout (variable snapKeepout) and the baseline length (variable snapBaselineLength).
Touchdown “Hard”: Specify the data length (variable hardLength).
Touchdown “Manual”: Specify the two intersection regions (variables ma1 to ma4).
3.	The notebook will produce a file named G.dat containing the complex shear modulus as a function of frequency.
